# Squishy

A simple image compression app made for the Picky interview.

## Setup

Clone this repository and `cd` into it

Build it: `docker build -t squishy .`

Run it: `docker run -p 3000:3000 squishy`

Go to `localhost:3000` and start using the app

## Usage

You have a button in the main section to upload an image.
Once uploaded you can select it in your galery on the right and then click the compress button.

## Feedback
I was not sure if the deadline was today the 10th or tomorrow Tuesday as the assignment deadline section indicated Tues 10th of February. I took the decision to submit it on the earlier end.

I wanted to go a bit further but I lacked of time due to my weekend being busier than what I had expected, I do not want to use this as an excuse, but it is what it is.

The assignment itself was pretty fun and interesting on many points, it was not too complicated as I already handled file uploads in my professional experience.

I wanted to handle error better, I also prepared everything on the backend to be able to let the user chose how to resize the image, and the general quality of the image also, but I ran out of time for the front end implementation.

After reading the assignement I immediately thought about Squoosh (https://squoosh.app/), and if I had more time I definitely would have gone for a front end in that flavor (the middle bar that you can move from left to right, showing the difference in quality is super cool!).

## AI usage
Running out of time, I used AI to generate some front end code, that I of course read back and modified to fit my needs.
